# open-resources

A curated, community-driven list of developer resources. Whether you're learning, building, or shipping.

Find tools, docs, and references in one place.

## How resources are organized

Resources live in **[resources.md](./resources.md)** and are grouped by precise category:

- **React frameworks** — Next.js, Expo
- **Headless components** — unstyled primitives (e.g. Base UI)
- **Designed components** — copy-paste UI (e.g. shadcn/ui)
- **Icons** — icon sets
- **Accessibility** — checklists, color contrast
- **Design** — checklists, palettes, wireframes
- **Data fetching** — TanStack Query, etc.
- **Validation** — Zod, etc.
- **Documentation** — docs lookup
- **Hosting** — deployment (e.g. Vercel)
- **Agentic development** — Cursor skills, AI agents, agentic workflows, MCP
- **Learning** — refactoring, TypeScript, skills

Each entry uses a consistent format: **name**, short **description**, and **link**.

## How to contribute

We use a simple contribution workflow so the list stays consistent and easy to maintain.

### Via Merge Request

1. **Fork** this repository.
2. **Create a branch** (e.g. `add-resource-react-query`).
3. **Add your resource** using the provided agentic skill or command (see [.cursor/skills/add-resource/SKILL.md](./.cursor/skills/add-resource/SKILL.md)). Do **not** edit `resources.md` by hand.
4. **Commit and push** your branch.
5. **Open a Merge Request** with a short description of the resource and why it’s useful.

### Important

**Please do not edit `resources.md` manually.** Use the add-resource skill/command so that:

- Formatting stays consistent
- Entries are placed in the right section
- The list stays sorted and easy to scan

We’re happy to have you contribute. Thanks for helping grow this list.
